This is the portfolio site for Lesley Anne Greene a ceramic artists based in East Yorkshire, United Kingdom.


## Development üêçüñ•Ô∏è

This project uses the following technologies

* Python 3.8
* Django 3
* pytest
* Javascript, Jquery
* HTML & CSS
* Bootstrap 4
* Terraform
* It is connected to a postgresql database instance
* Static files are saved to Amazon S3


### Getting started ‚öôÔ∏è

There is a pipenv virtual environment set up for this repo. To install all the packages and enter it's shell use the following commands:

``` sh 
# in the root directory
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you want to create an app and resources from this code you can do so with terraform, more information on how to do so can be found [here](../terraform/READMe.md)

The postgresql Database requires a password, you can save this in a `.env` file. Copy the `.template_env`, fill in the values and rename it.

To run the following Django commands you must be inside the pipenv shell and `cd` into the `/app` directory:

``` sh
# Make migrations
python manage.py makemigrations

# See migrations as SQL:
python manage.py sqlmigrate index 0001

# Implement migrations
python manage.py migrate

# You can also add the app name at the end to apply migrations only from that app.

#Collect Static files - if $USE_S3 is set to TRUE then files will be saved to S3 Bucket
python manage.py collectstatic

#Run the tests
python manage.py test

#Run the server default port is 8000
python manage.py runserver
```

#### Creating a local database for local development

For development you may want to have your own local database and save static files locally instead of using Amazon S3.

A local copy of the Heroku postgres can be made with the following command:

``` sh
PGUSER=postgres PGPASSWORD=password heroku pg:pull DATABASE_URL nameforlocaldb
```

*Note that PGUSER and PGPASSWORD set the authentication credentials for the local db, and the Django app has the database URL saved as an environment variable.*

[DJ-Database-URL](https://github.com/kennethreitz/dj-database-url) utility is used to configure the enbironment variable of the database so all that is now needed is to update the `$DATABASE_URL` value to the new local database:

``` sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/nameforlocaldb
```
You will have to run the migrations on the local database and also create a super user `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`.


To stop using S3 for static and media files set the environment variable `$USE_S3` to `FALSE`. 


#### Starting the app with Gunicorn ü¶Ñ

You can also run the App with Gunicorn by running  `gunicorn portfolio_site.wsgi:application`


#### Run inside a container with Docker üêã

The app can also be ran within a docker container, first build the app with:

`make docker-build`

then run the image:

`make run-in-docker`

#### Other documentation üóíÔ∏è

[Here](docs/development_notes.md) you will find some notes taken during the development of this site which include useful commands, links and tutorials.


### Linting üö©

This project has python linting set up using [pycodestyle]() to run it use `pycodestyle .` [Autopep 8]() can be used to change files in place with the following command: `autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive ./<file-path>`
